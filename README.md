#### Setting up repl.it code challenges
Per Emily:
1. Log into repl.it - you should see the classrooms
2. When you click on CS7's classroom there should be 3 tabs: published, scheduled, and drafts.
3. Under drafts, find the code challenge and click on it.
4. On it's main page on the top right you can schedule it.
5. Select tomorrow and set the time to 7:59 AM (I do 8, but I'm a rebel)
6. You can always go back to the scheduled version, click to open it up and you'll have options to edit the tests etc. If you scroll all the way to the bottom, there's a link to the model solution. That's the one the students will see after submission, and the one you can share if you don't want to write one.

#### Slack `/polly` polls
- oh, it's a thing now with a web interface... templates... all that.

#### Slack `/jibble` timeclock
- who comes up with these names?

#### [Code Review Checklist](https://github.com/mixelpixel/Code-Review-Checklist)
- Get on it!

#### Truth Table: Inclusive Or
- If ANY one of the variables evaluates to `true`, then the entire proposition evaluates to `true`.
- There are three terms: `phi`, `psi` & `fry`.
- Each term has two possible states: `true` or `false`.
- The total number of _possible_ combination of three terms which each have two possible states is:
- 2<super>3</super>, or eight:

phi | psi | fry | phi or psi or fry
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
T | T | T | True
T | T | F | True
T | F | T | True
T | F | F | True
F | T | T | True
F | T | F | True
F | F | T | True
F | F | F | False
